Please note that all cluster of that report are independent and have their very own description & argumentation. An issue per cluster would be a better option, but it is impossible as that many opened issues would result in my account being flagged for spam by Github.

# Detailed Methodology & Walkthrough

After gathering as many hot wallet addresses and gas suppliers for several centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Bybit, and OKX using blockchain explorers, a simple Dune SQL request was employed to collect around 2.5 million CEX deposit addresses. These are the addresses where users send assets to deposit into a CEX.

Using Dune Dashboard again, I filtered these CEX deposit addresses to identify those that received funds from at least seven addresses that regularly interacted with LayerZero (using an unofficial Dune Dashboard).

Clusters of 7-300 active LayerZero addresses sharing the same CEX deposit address were formed. A script then expanded these clusters by including addresses interacting with the cluster addresses but not directly with the CEX deposit address. To minimize false positives, an address needed to be linked to at least four other cluster addresses to join. Clusters with fewer than 20 addresses (21 including the CEX deposit address) were discarded.

This initial detection/proof layer is fully automated, leveraging scripts to create clusters. Although these clusters are less common due to the requirement of multiple interactions and the common CEX deposit address, a small percentage of false positives remains.

The second detection/proof layer involves manual verification. Each cluster in this report underwent thorough manual inspection to remove false positives and add on-chain arguments supporting the cluster's sybil nature. These on-chain arguments vary, such as addresses within a cluster executing identical transactions simultaneously with the same amounts, or showing similar transaction patterns for LayerZero activities. Resources like LayerZero Scan, Dune, Debank, Arkham, Etherscan, and others were extensively used.

This manual verification, despite being time-consuming, ensures a high accuracy rate by minimizing false positives and demonstrating that the report is not merely a dump of addresses. The combination of automated clustering and manual verification, along with the consistent use of the same CEX deposit address and similar on-chain activities, provides robust detection with minimal false positives.

The activity predating the snapshot was screened across 14 blockchains: Ethereum (endblock 19757726), Optimism (endblock 119326917), BSC (endblock 38236464), Polygon (endblock 56379454), Arbitrum (endblock 205653169), Gnosis (endblock 33677943), Linea (endblock 4059728), Scroll (endblock 5184468), Zksync (endblock 32656745), Moonbeam (endblock 6045324), Moonriver (endblock 6637617), Fantom (endblock 80127182), Base (endblock 13709885), and Celo (endblock 25273962).

Lastly, please note that Arkham diagrams in this report may often lack links, as Arkham only supports 7 out of these 14 blockchains.

As the cluster are independant and a description comes with every cluster, the two following sections have been regrouped.

This following section is an rotation of the list of the addresses of the cluster and its description: the CEX deposit address some of the addresses share, an Arkham diagram & the second layer of detection.



# Reported Addresses & Description


## CLUSTER 1


The first 10 addresses of the cluster share the same Binance deposit address 0xd2E1cC562786cE8d803128FD8710B79CCCd28260. The rest are linked to numerous addresses of the cluster, multiple times.

The addresses all have the same on-chain activity. For example, the 29/04, the same transaction was made nearly at the same time for 10 of the adresses: interaction with mintCube.

The addresses also all have similar scam tx recognized by debank.

The address share the same CEX deposit address, are part of a cluster with multiple links between one another, and have the same on-chain activity. This is a big scale sybil operation, probably the result of scripts.

## CLUSTER 2

The first 10 addresses of the cluster share the same Binance deposit address 0x70D4282501F8951FeDe458ac53B7D4BBC5360483. The rest are linked to numerous addresses of the cluster.

The addresses have the same on-chain activity. Here we can observe the same interaction with Galxe approximately at the time :

Cluster + same CEX deposit address + same on-chain activity. Without a doubt a sybil cluster.
